TSAI-END-Session1 Assignment by Girish Nautiyal



This repository is for session 1 assignment on the basics of Neural Networks. This contains Jupyter Notebook of the practice code. Also, below are some of the basic concepts of the Neural Networks:

### Problem Statement

1. What is a neural network neuron?  

**Ans:** A neuron is a point of information in the Neural Network. It contains the information that has been propagated till that point.

2. What is the use of the learning rate?  

**Ans:** The learning rate is utilized to improve the Neural Network step by step. If the learning rate is too low, the model might take too long get the optimized state. If the learning rate is too high, the model might overshot the optimized state loss and might not be able to reach optimized state. That is why it is imperative to have optimum learning rate. 

3. How are weights initialized?  

**Ans:** The weights are initialized randomly but there are a couple of other factors as well to how the weights actually would be. The distribution (Normal or uniform) of the weights to be initialized would also depend on the activation function being used.

4. What is "loss" in a neural network?  

**Ans:** The loss is what we typically call the error in prediction of an algorithm. In Neural Network also, we try to minimize the loss using a loss function so that our model is as accurate as possible

5. What is the "chain rule" in gradient flow?  

**Ans:** The chain rule in gradient flow comes into play when we need the derivative of an expression consisting of multiple expressions. It helps us by taking derivative of an expression into the next stage and so on. Thus we keep calculating derivatives at each stage of the network propagation
